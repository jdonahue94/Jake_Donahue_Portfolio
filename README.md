### Model 1 - Ty Pennington
Ty Pennington is an XGBoost predictice model that I have built to predict residential housing prices in Ames Iowa. XGBoost is the leading model for working with standard tabular data (the type of data you store in Pandas DataFrames, as opposed to more exotic types of data like images and videos). XGBoost has become a widely used and really popular tool among Kaggle competitors and Data Scientists in industry, as it has been battle tested for production on large-scale problems. It is a highly flexible and versatile tool that can work through most regression, classification and ranking problems as well as user-built objective functions.
