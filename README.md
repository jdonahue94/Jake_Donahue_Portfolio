# Model 1 - Ty Pennington
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. This dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Groveland MA, this data set challenges us to predict the final price of each home. However, what this data set does not account for is what I believe to be one of the most valuable determinants of price, "beauty lies in the eye of the beholder." In other words, the value of a house is often subjective - what one person values at 1,000,000 another may value at 875,000

Ty Pennington is an XGBoost predictive model trained to predict residential housing prices in Groveland MA. XGBoost is the leading model for working with standard tabular data (the type of data you store in Pandas DataFrames, as opposed to more exotic types of data like images and videos). XGBoost has become a widely used and really popular tool among Kaggle competitors and Data Scientists, as it has been battle tested for production on large-scale problems. It is a highly flexible and versatile tool that can work through most regression, classification and ranking problems as well as user-built objective functions.

## Part 1 - Data Cleaning
Does my data contain outliers? What should I do about missing values? Is my data skewed? Why arenâ€™t my dates formatted correctly? Data cleaning answers these questions and provides intuitive solutions. Arguably the most important step in the data science process, data cleaning can easily become deeply frustrating and time intensive. Recent studies suggest that data scientists spend anywhere from 50% to 80% of their time cleaning data rather than creating insights.

### Handling Missing Values
Python libraries represent missing numbers as NaN which is short for "not a number". Most libraries (including scikit-learn) will give you an error if you try to build a model using data with missing values. In general, one can either drop columns with missing values or impute missing values. Dropping columns entirely can be useful when most values in a column are missing. Imputation fills in the missing value with some number. The imputed value won't be exactly right, however, it helps to produce more accurate predictive models.

```python
# Calculating and visualizing the percent of missing values per feature
sns.set_style("darkgrid")
missing = df.isnull().sum()
missing = missing[missing > 0]
missing = (missing / len(df)) * 100
missing.sort_values(ascending=True, inplace=True)
sns.barplot(x=missing.tail(15), y=missing.tail(15).index)
plt.xlabel("Percentage of Missing Columns", fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel("Feature", fontsize=12)
plt.title("Percent of Missing Values by Feature", fontsize=15);
```

```python
# Miscellaneous features (None)
df["PoolQC"] = df["PoolQC"].fillna("None")
df["MiscFeature"] = df["MiscFeature"].fillna("None")
df["Alley"] = df["Alley"].fillna("None")
df["Fence"] = df["Fence"].fillna("None")
df["FireplaceQu"] = df["FireplaceQu"].fillna("None")
df['MSSubClass'] = df['MSSubClass'].fillna("None")
df["MasVnrType"] = df["MasVnrType"].fillna("None")
df["Functional"] = df["Functional"].fillna("Typ")
```
```python
# Miscellaneous features (mode)
df["MSZoning"] = df["MSZoning"].fillna(df["MSZoning"].mode()[0])
df["Electrical"] = df["Electrical"].fillna(df["Electrical"].mode()[0])
df["KitchenQual"] = df["KitchenQual"].fillna(df["KitchenQual"].mode()[0])
df["Exterior1st"] = df["Exterior1st"].fillna(df["Exterior1st"].mode()[0])
df["Exterior2nd"] = df["Exterior2nd"].fillna(df["Exterior2nd"].mode()[0])
df["SaleType"] = df["SaleType"].fillna(df["SaleType"].mode()[0])
df["MasVnrArea"] = df["MasVnrArea"].fillna(0)
```
```python
# Garage features
for column in ("GarageType", "GarageFinish", "GarageQual", "GarageCond"): df[column] = df[column].fillna("None")
for column in ("GarageYrBlt", "GarageArea", "GarageCars"): df[column] = df[column].fillna(0)

# Basement features
for column in ("BsmtFinSF1", "BsmtFinSF2", "BsmtUnfSF", "TotalBsmtSF", "BsmtFullBath", "BsmtHalfBath"): df[column] = df[column].fillna(0)
for column in ("BsmtQual", "BsmtCond", "BsmtExposure", "BsmtFinType1", "BsmtFinType2"): df[column] = df[column].fillna('None')
```
```python
# Slightly more intuitive fills
dataset.drop("LotFrontage", axis=1, inplace=True)
neighborhoodfrontage = train.groupby("Neighborhood")[["LotFrontage"]].median()#.rename({"Median": "LotFrontage"}, axis=1)
dataset = dataset.merge(neighborhoodfrontage, left_on="Neighborhood", right_index=True, how="left")
```

### Outliers
In plain english, an outlier is an observation that diverges from an overall pattern within a sample. Mathematically, an outlier is usually defined as an observation more than three standard deviations from the mean (although sometimes you'll see 2.5 or 2 as well). Most machine learning algorithms do not work well in the presence of outliers, as they are known to skew mean and standard deviation, reduce the effectiveness of statistical tests and decrease normality.

There is no precise way to define outliers in general because of the specifics of each data set. However, there are multiple methods that can be used to identify "potential" otliers. As the domain experts, we must interpret the observations and decide whether a value is an outlier or not. Said identification methods include Z-scores, Robust Z-scores, I.Q.R measurements and basic visualizations.

* `Univariate outliers` - can be found when we look at distribution of a single variable. Boxplots are commonly used to visualize and detect univariate outliers.
* `Multi-variate outliers` - are outliers in an n-dimensional space. In order to find them, you have to look at distributions in multi-dimensions.

```python
# Multi-variate analysis saleprice/grlivarea
sns.set_style('darkgrid')
fig = sns.scatterplot(data=df, x=df['GrLivArea'], y=df['SalePrice'])
fig.set(xlabel='Living Area', ylabel='Sale Price', title='Living Area vs Sale Price (w/outliers)');
```
<img src="https://github.com/jdonahue94/DonnyDoesDataScience1/blob/main/visualizations/outliarzzz.PNG?raw=true" width="500" height="300" />

```python
# intuitively deleting outliers (bottom right corner)
df = df.drop(df[(df['GrLivArea']>4000) & (df['SalePrice']<300000)].index)

# Visualization w/o outliers
sns.set_style('darkgrid')
fig = sns.scatterplot(data=df, x=df['GrLivArea'], y=df['SalePrice'])
fig.set(xlabel='Living Area', ylabel='Sale Price', title='Living Area vs Sale Price (w/o outliers)');
```
<img src="https://github.com/jdonahue94/DonnyDoesDataScience1/blob/main/visualizations/nooutliarz.PNG?raw=true" width="500" height="300" />

Note - I've decided to delete only two observations as they are blatant outliers (extremely large areas for very low prices). The training data probably contains additional outliers, however, removing all outliers may actually negatively impact our model if ever outliers were present in the test data. Instead of removing all outliers, I'll address skewed data in later sections and train our model to be robust on outliers.

### Skewness & Kurtosis
Skewness measures the degree of distortion from the symmetrical bell curve or the normal distribution. A symmetrical or normal distribution will have a skewness of 0. Skewness between -0.5 and 0.5 is considered fairly symmetrical. Skewness between -1 and -0.5 or between 0.5 and 1 is considered moderately skewed. Skewness less than -1 or greater than 1 is considered highly skewed.

* `Positive Skewness` - when the tail on the right side of the distribution is longer or fatter. The mean and median will be greater than the mode.
* `Negative Skewness` - is when the tail of the left side of the distribution is longer or fatter than the tail on the right side. The mean and median will be less than the mode.

Kurtosis is used to describe/measure the extreme values in one versus the other tail. It is actually the measure of outliers present in the distribution. High kurtosis in a data set is an indicator that data has heavy tails or outliers. Low kurtosis in a data set is an indicator that data has light tails or lack of outliers.

```python
# Visualizing the distribution of our target variable
sns.distplot(df['SalePrice'], fit=norm);

# calculate the fitted parameters used by the function
(mu, sigma) = norm.fit(df['SalePrice'])

# Plotting the distribution
plt.legend(['Normal dist. ($\mu=${:.2f} and $\sigma=${:.2f} )'.format(mu, sigma)], loc='best')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('SalePrice distribution')
plt.ticklabel_format(style='plain');

# Visualize the QQ-plot
fig = plt.figure()
res = stats.probplot(df['SalePrice'], plot=plt)
plt.show();
```

Note - Our target variable (SalePrice) is clearly skewed to the right. Most ML models don't do well with non-normally distributed data. We can apply a log(1+x) transformation to fix the skew. Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.

```python
# log(1+x) transformation
normalized = df.copy()
normalized["SalePrice"] = np.log1p(normalized["SalePrice"])

# Visualizing the distribution of our normalized target variable
sns.distplot(normalized['SalePrice'] , fit=norm);

# Calculate the fitted parameters used by the function
(mu, sigma) = norm.fit(normalized['SalePrice'])

# Plotting the distribution
plt.legend(['Normal dist. ($\mu=$ {:.2f} and $\sigma=$ {:.2f} )'.format(mu, sigma)], loc='best')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('SalePrice distribution')
plt.ticklabel_format(style='plain');

# Visualize the QQ-plot
fig = plt.figure()
res = stats.probplot(normalized['SalePrice'], plot=plt)
plt.show()
```
