# Executive Summary

Greetings,
My name is Jake Donahue. Thanks for visiting my personal data science portfolio. I currently work as an Analytics Engineer at Wayfair and I'm actively pursuing a career in data science. Prior to Wayfair I graduated from Babson College where I studied entrepreneurial finance and played ice hockey. In recent years big data has become my passion. Specifically, i'm obsessed with the innovation that can be created and captured at the crossroads of data science, economics, finance and machine learning. Within this portfolio I'll share my most recent analyses. Enjoy!
