# Model 1 - Ty Pennington
Ty Pennington is an XGBoost predictive model built to predict residential housing prices in Ames Iowa. XGBoost is the leading model for working with standard tabular data (the type of data you store in Pandas DataFrames, as opposed to more exotic types of data like images and videos). XGBoost has become a widely used and really popular tool among Kaggle competitors and Data Scientists in industry, as it has been battle tested for production on large-scale problems. It is a highly flexible and versatile tool that can work through most regression, classification and ranking problems as well as user-built objective functions. 

### Introduction
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. What this data set does not account for is what I believe to be one of the most valuable determinants of price, "beauty lies in the eye of the beholder." In other words, the value of a house is often subjective - what one person values at 1,000,000 another may value at 875,000

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in (INSERT TOWN HERE), this data set challenges us to predict the final price of each home.
